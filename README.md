### Hi there 👋

I'm Audrey and after 8 years as a sales person in the tech industry (fintech), I decided that I wanted to particpate in the construction of solutions (and get my hands dirty!🔧). Also my fellow dev colleagues were sick and tired to see me show up at their sprint reviews 😅 and could not believe that a sales could actually say no to a client (neither did my boss! 😬)

I graduated from Le Wagon bootcamp in March 2023 🎓 and I'm looking forward to working with amazing people on products I believe in! 

🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects: wed-app as I'm getting married in 2024! 💍🥳 and looking for an automated booking-solution for my husband-to-be's company that accomodates private cruises on the Seine River ⛵⚓ (checkout @MyParisRiver)

🔎 If someone knows about @airtable, I would be very interested! 🤓

💬 Ask me about etymology, I am passionate about languages & idioms (no wonder I wanted to learn a programming language! 😜)

⚡ Fun facts: did you know that...

Dunce before becoming the derogatory name we know was a person named John Duns Scotus? We are all someone's dunce! 🤪

Budget originally comes from "bougette", a word used in the Middle-Ages in France 🇫🇷 to refer to a little bag that contained money 💰 it was borrowed by the English 🇬🇧 as "budget" and then came back to France where we now have the word "budget" while bougette has disappeared! 😮
