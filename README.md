### Hi there 👋

I'm Audrey and after 8 years as a sales person in the tech industry (fintech), I decided that I wanted to particpate in the construction of solutions (and get my hands dirty!🔧). Also my fellow dev colleagues were sick and tired to see me show up at their sprint reviews 😅 and could not believe that a sales could actually say no to a client (neither did my boss! 😬)

I graduated from Le Wagon bootcamp in March 2023 🎓 and I'm looking forward to working with amazing people on products I believe in! 

🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects: wed-app as I'm getting married in 2024! 💍🥳 and an automated booking-solution for my husband-to-be's company that accomodates private cruises on the Seine River ⛵⚓ checkout @MyParisRiver

💬 Ask me about etymology, I am passionate about languages, idioms (
